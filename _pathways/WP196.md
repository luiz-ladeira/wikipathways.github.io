description: 'The tripeptide glutathione (GSH: L-&gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine)
  is a prevalent intracellular thiol that is able to act as a cellular redox buffer
  due to its low redox potential (as reviewed in (CITS: [12702279])). GSH is involved
  in many biological processes including: protein and DNA synthesis; amino acid transport;
  enzyme regulation; protection of cells against reactive oxygen compounds and free
  radicals, xenobiotics and heavy metals (as reviewed in (CITS: [12702279])). GSH
  can also be used as a source of sulfur and cysteine in (CITS: [1674526], [10514563]).  GSH
  is synthesized from its constituent amino acids by two ATP-dependent steps (as reviewed
  in (CITS: [12702279])). In the first step &gamma;-glutamylcysteine synthetase (Gsh1p)
  catalyzes the formation of the dipeptide &gamma;-glutamylcysteine from glutamate
  and cysteine. In the second step, GSH synthetase (Gsh2p) catalyzes the ligation
  of glycine with &gamma;-glutamylcysteine to form GSH. GSH is an essential reductant
  in yeast during normal metabolic processes (CITS: [8662189]), but the dipeptide
  &gamma;-glutamylcysteine is able to substitute for GSH as an antioxidant (CITS:
  [9307967]).  GSH biosynthesis is co-regulated by Met4p, a transcription factor that
  induces expression of genes involved in sulfur assimilation, by Yap1p, a stress-responsive
  transcription factor, and by GSH feedback inhibition, which inhibits both GSH1 expression
  and Gsh1p enzyme activity (CITS: [12406228], [14514673]).  Expression of GSH1 and
  GSH2 is induced by oxidative stress in a Yap1p-dependent manner with subsequent
  increases in intracellular GSH content (CITS: [7915005], [10809786]).  GSH1 is also
  transcriptionally up-regulated by the heavy metal cadmium in the presence of Met4p
  and the DNA-binding proteins Met31p and Met32p (CITS: [9044254], [10921921]).  SOURCE:
