description: 'This pathway describes parallel and converging signaling pathways driven
  by Gαq (GNAQ) in Uveal Melanoma, and the inhibitory effects of Darovasertib and
  FAKi (FAK inhibitor). Key points from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/
  Arang et al]: Darovasertib is a dual inhibitor of PKC and PRK/PKN; downstream of
  mutant Gαq darovasertib blocks ERK and diminishes FAK activity; Darovasertib and
  FAKi act synergistically in preclinical uveal melanoma models.  This pathway model
  was developed based on Figure 7 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/
  Arang et al].'
