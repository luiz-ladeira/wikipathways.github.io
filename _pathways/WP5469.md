description: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark of cancer metastasis.
  EMT is a process that allows epithelial cells to lose their epithelial characteristics
  and gain mesenchymal features, which makes them more invasive and migratory. This
  process is a key part of tumor progression and metastasis. EMT gives cancer cells
  stem-cell properties and makes them resistant to chemotherapy drugs.
