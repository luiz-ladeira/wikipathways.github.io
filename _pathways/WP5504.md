description: This pathway lists several genes involved in mechanisms involved in disorders
  of mitochondrial homeostatis, dynamics, protein import, and quality control. This
  pathway was inspired by Figure 46.1 of Edition 5, Chapter 46 of the book of Blau
  (ISBN 9783030677268). Genes linked to a disease in this book chapter are depicted
  in red.
