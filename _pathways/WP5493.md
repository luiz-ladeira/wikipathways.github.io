description: 'Effect of dasatinib on the BCR-ABL signaling pathway, showing phosphorylation
  sites that were found to be suppressed by Dasatinib are shown (Pan et al). Key signaling
  events in the three major MAPK cascades were suppressed, including the activation
  loop phosphorylation sites of p38α/β (MAPK11) and ERK1/2 (MAPK1/MAPK3).  Based on
  fig 6 from https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2816010/Phosphorylation site
  information is based on the left-side panel in the figure; not all sites could be
  verified in independent sources (e.g. PhosphositePlus). '
