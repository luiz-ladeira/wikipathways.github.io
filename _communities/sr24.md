description: "The [Serious Request](https://www.npo3fm.nl/kominactie) 2024 action is to raise funding for [MetaKids](https://metakids.nl/),
  a Dutch foundation that aims for a world in which metabolic diseases can be treated or prevented and
  where no kid has to suffers from these diseases.
  
  <p>This WikiPathways actions aims to raise funding for the Serious Request 2024 action and in return
  we will work in December on improving the digitalized versions of the latest literature about the
  biological process that are behind or could perhaps explain these metabolic diseases.
  
  <p>This page lists the pathways we worked on during the action or are otherwise relevant to
  the work by the MetaKids foundation. We further have <a href="https://github.com/orgs/wikipathways/projects/2/views/1">this project board</a>
  to monitor the specific tasks, in an open notebook science sense.
  
  <p>See also the \"WikiPathways in actie voor MetaKids\" <a href="https://www.npo3fm.nl/kominactie/acties/wikipathways-in-actie-voor-metakids">page</a> where you can donate money for MetaKids."
